Dart Getters and Setters

 The getter method is used to reads the value 
 of the variable.
 setter method is used to set or 
 initialize respective class fields. 
 
 we can override the default methods by defining getter and setter method explicitly.

 Getters and setters are the special class method that is used to read and write
 access to an object's properties.

 set field_name {  
}  

get field_name{  
}
